# Diffusion Model for Image Denoising and Classification

This project implements a diffusion model for image denoising and classification tasks using PyTorch. It includes a UNet architecture with sinusoidal position embeddings and label conditioning. The model is trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## Installation

To run this project, you'll need to have Python 3.x installed along with the following libraries:

- PyTorch
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```
pip install torch torchvision matplotlib numpy pillow
```

## Usage

- **DiffusionModel.ipynb**: This Jupyter Notebook contains the main implementation of the diffusion model, including classes for image denoising, training, and evaluation.

- **Notebook**: The notebook includes sections for data loading, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

- **Sample Images**: A sample image of a raccoon is provided for testing the denoising and classification functionalities.

- **README.md**: This file provides an overview of the project, installation instructions, and usage guidelines.
